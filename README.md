# DataHub.local

DataHub.local is a powerful data platform designed for edge devices, enabling seamless analytics and insights at home. The idea is to create a fully functional data platform like [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) but that could run in low-end devices.

## Features

- Efficient data processing
- Edge device compatibility
- Seamless analytics
- Easy deployment
