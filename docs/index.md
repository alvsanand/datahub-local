DataHub.local is a powerful data platform designed for edge devices, enabling seamless analytics and insights at home. The idea is to create a fully functional data platform like [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) but that could run in low-end devices.

**CAUTION**: this is just a personal project with no more ambitions that learn and enjoy with the techonology.

## Features

- Efficient data processing
